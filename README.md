    Custom Integration for HomeAssistant to allow remote control of Dometic/MicroAir Easytouch OEM Wi-Fi Thermostats for RV and Marine use.

    This integration is not complete but definitely works, and is still considered a work in progress. Need to add (where supported by the hardware) external humidity and temperature sensor support, as well as line voltage reading support in the sensor domain.
